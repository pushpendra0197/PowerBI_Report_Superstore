# Report on superstore Dataset -
i have created Report on superstore dataset. in which i cleaned the data first because data contained the blank,missing values and irrelevant rows. 
Than after i divided data into facts and dimension for better analysis. Then i created relationship between the table in model view. 
then i used different types of charts for data visulization. Reason of creating the dashboard to understand the data better in better
way by seeing visuals because visuals gives clear insights of data as compares to Raw data.
